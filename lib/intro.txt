Used as a library for fetching data from the file system 

also sometimes called the utils folder 

In posts.js, we fetch and parse the files in posts directory to get blog posts. 

We could also fetch data from other sources, like an external API endpoint. 
E.g. 
export async function getSortedPostsData() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from an external API endpoint
  const res = await fetch('..');
  return res.json();
}

Or we could query from a database directly: 
E.g. 
import someDatabaseSDK from 'someDatabaseSDK'

const databaseClient = someDatabaseSDK.createClient(...)

export async function getSortedPostsData() {
  // Instead of the file system,
  // fetch post data from a database
  return databaseClient.query('SELECT posts...')
}

Note: Each of these functions could take the place of the function in /lib/posts.js 

Note: we can do these because getStaticProps (in the index.js file) only runs on the server side, it will never run on the client-side. 
It wonâ€™t even be included in the JS bundle for the browser. 
That means you can write code such as direct database queries without them being sent to browsers.
